# Process IO

Input/output, commonly abbreviated as I/O, refers to the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer) and the outside world. It encompasses the transfer of data to and from external devices, such as keyboards, monitors, printers, storage devices, and networks. In computing, efficient I/O operations are crucial for the overall performance and usability of a system. Whether it's reading data from a disk, sending information over a network, or displaying output to a user, effective management of I/O resources is essential for ensuring smooth and responsive interactions between users and machines.

<details><summary>Process Symbols</summary>
<br>

These symbols can be combined and expanded to create complex diagrams that depict the flow of activities, decisions, and interactions within a software input and output process.

### Process (→)
A single process, represented by an arrow (→), signifies a linear progression from one step to the next.
```
Example: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
```
This means that the process starts at step 0, moves to step 1, and then to step 2.

#

### Multiprocess (⇄ ⇅ ⇆ ⇇ ⇈ ⇉ ⇊)
A multiprocess involves multiple parallel activities, and it's represented using various symbols. The specific symbol denotes the synchronization or interaction between these activities.
```
Example: 0/0 ⇄ 1/1 ⇉ 2/2
```
This means there are three parallel activities (0, 1, and 2), and the symbols indicate how they interact. In this case, ⇄ suggests they interact closely, while ⇉ indicates a more separated interaction.

#

### Preprocess (↝)
A preprocess is an initial step before the main process, often used for data preparation or setup.
```
Example: 0 ↝ 1
```
This means that step 0 is a preprocessing step that leads to the main process at step 1.

#

### Midprocess (↯)
A midprocess symbolizes intermediate steps within the overall process.
```
Example: 1 ↯ 2
```
This represents an intermediate step occurring between step 1 and step 2.

#

### Postprocess (↦)
A postprocess is a step that occurs after the main process, often used for finalization or cleanup.
```
Example: 4 ↦ 5
```
This means that step 5 is a postprocessing step following step 4.

#

### Reprocess (↺)
Reprocess indicates that a step is being revisited or iterated upon.
```
Example: 3 ↺
```
This means that step 3 is revisited for reprocessing.

#

### Alternating process (⇄)
An alternating process involves steps that alternate or switch between different paths.
```
Example: (3 ⇄ 4)
```
This represents a situation where the process can alternate between step 3 and step 4.

#

### Subprocesses (⇢)
Subprocesses represent a hierarchical structure, where a main process is broken down into smaller subprocesses.
```
Example: 0 ⇢ 1 ⇢ 2 ⇢ 3
```
This signifies that there's a main process (0) that is divided into multiple subprocesses (1, 2, 3).

#

### Process interception (↗ ↙)
Process interception symbols indicate branching or decisions within the process.
```
Example: 2 ↗ 3 ↙ 4
```
This suggests that at step 2, the process can either move to step 3 or step 4 based on a decision.

#

### Optional process (↷)
An optional process is a step that may or may not be executed, depending on certain conditions.
```
Example: 3 ↷
```
This implies that step 3 is optional and may or may not be included in the process.

#

### Joint process (↭)
A joint process symbolizes the convergence of multiple paths or activities into a single path.
```
Example: (3 ↭ 4)
```
This represents a point where multiple activities (3 and 4) merge into a single path.

<details><summary>Data Backup and Recovery Process Example</summary>
<br>

1. Preprocess: Check if backup is needed (↝).
2. Parallel Process: Back up databases and user files simultaneously (⫸).
3. Process: Verify integrity of backups (→).
4. Conditional Process: If verification fails, reprocess backup (⇏).
5. Reprocess: Redo backup process (↺).
6. Optional Process: Notify admin if multiple failures occur (↷).
7. Postprocess: Log completion (↦).

Diagram:

```
↝ Check backup needed ⫸ [Back up databases ⇆ Back up user files] → Verify backups ⇏ {If fail} ↺ Redo backup ↷ Notify admin (optional) → ↦ Log completion
```

<details><summary>Process of Elimination</summary>
<br>

The "Process of Elimination" is represented by a sequence of steps starting with identifying potential candidates. These candidates are then evaluated based on specific criteria. As part of a divergent process, each candidate is subsequently processed individually. The results from each are reviewed, culminating in a final decision. This methodical approach helps in systematically narrowing down options to reach a definitive conclusion.

```
Start → Identify Candidates → Evaluate Criteria → Apply Criteria (⇛) → 
Candidate 1 (↦) → Candidate 2 (↦) → Candidate 3 (↦) → 
Review Results → Final Decision
```

<details><summary>Super Mario Process Example</summary>
<br>

The process diagram for the Super Mario video game captures the essential gameplay loop, starting from the initial game launch to the decision to proceed to the next level or replay the current one. The game begins with the player starting up and selecting a level. Once a level is chosen, the main gameplay segment, labeled as "Play Level," unfolds through several subprocesses. These include navigating the terrain, where the player moves through the level layout, encountering various enemies in alternating patterns, and collecting essential items like coins and power-ups. Optionally, players might pass checkpoints that save their progress. Towards the end of the level, there might be a boss fight, represented as a process interception, which the player must overcome to complete the level. After defeating the boss or reaching the level's end, the game displays results and rewards, followed by a decision point where the player can choose to advance to the next level or replay the current one, illustrating an iterative nature of gameplay. This diagram effectively outlines the dynamic and interactive elements of the Super Mario gameplay experience.

```
Start Game (↝) → Select Level (→) → Play Level (↯)
  ↳ Navigate Terrain (⇢) → Encounter Enemies (⇄) → Collect Items (⇢) → Checkpoints (↷) 
  ↳ Level Boss (↖) → Complete Level (↦) → Results (↦) → Next Level/Replay (↺) → [back to Select Level (→)]
```

<details><summary>Graduation Process</summary>
<br>

The graduation process typically involves a series of structured stages that mark the transition of students from one academic level to another, culminating in a formal ceremony. This process begins with the preprocess of meeting academic requirements, followed by application for graduation. After approval, the midprocess involves preparations for the ceremony, including gown rental and invitations. The postprocess is the graduation ceremony itself, and finally, there is an optional process for attending graduation parties or events.

```
Academic Requirements (↝) → Application for Graduation (→) → Ceremony Preparation (↯) → Graduation Ceremony (↦) → Graduation Parties (↷)
```

<details><summary>Degradation Process</summary>
<br>

The degradation process refers to the decline or reduction in quality, effectiveness, or condition of a software system over time, typically due to factors like system use, environmental conditions, or lack of maintenance. Initially, the system operates optimally (preprocess). Over time, performance may begin to decline (midprocess), and without intervention, the system may reach a critical point of degradation (postprocess). Recovery efforts (reprocess) can be initiated if the degradation is detected early enough.

Battery degradation in electric vehicles (EVs) is a process where the battery's capacity to hold charge diminishes over time due to repeated charge and discharge cycles. The process starts with the initial operation of the battery at full capacity (preprocess). As the vehicle is used and the battery undergoes cycles, its capacity gradually decreases (midprocess). Eventually, the battery may reach a stage where it can no longer support the vehicle's range requirements (postprocess). At this stage, battery management strategies or replacement (reprocess) can be considered to restore functionality.

```
Initial Operation (↝) → Capacity Decrease (↯) → Range Inadequacy (↦) → Management/Replacement (↺)
```

<details><summary>Process Structure</summary>
<br>

The structure of a process in software or systems engineering is designed to outline the sequential and logical order of tasks required to accomplish a specific goal. This structure often represents the flow of data and control through various stages of operation, clearly delineating the start, intermediate steps, and end of the process. It includes a series of actions or operations that may involve decision-making branches, parallel execution paths, and loops, which are strategically organized to optimize performance, maintainability, and scalability. The effective structuring of these processes is critical for ensuring that the system operates smoothly and meets its designated outcomes efficiently.

Process structure can be categorized into various levels and types, each serving distinct roles within a larger system. At the most basic level, simple processes like sorting or filtering involve straightforward, linear sequences of steps. More complex processes, such as distributed computing or machine learning model training, incorporate multiple layers that may include subprocesses and require sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Types of processes vary widely, ranging from sequential and batch processing to real-time and interactive processing. Additionally, processes can be synchronous, executing steps in a strict order, or asynchronous, allowing steps to occur independently. Understanding and designing these levels and types appropriately is essential for crafting systems that are robust, flexible, and capable of handling the demands of varied operational environments.

<details><summary>Process Hierarchy</summary>
<br>

Process hierarchy levels and types are fundamental concepts in both software development and systems engineering, providing a structured approach to managing complex operations. At the highest level, processes may be broadly categorized into main processes, subprocesses, and auxiliary processes, each serving specific roles within the overall system. Main processes are the core functional tasks that drive the primary objectives of the system. Subprocesses break down these main tasks into smaller, more manageable units that are easier to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot. Auxiliary processes include support tasks such as logging, monitoring, and configuration, which are essential for the smooth operation but are not directly involved in the primary functional flow.

   |
   └── Postprocess (↦)
         ├── Data Visualization (→)
         └── Reporting (→)
```

This structure exemplifies the complexity and depth of operations that can be part of a complex software process, illustrating the use of multiple process types to achieve comprehensive results.
